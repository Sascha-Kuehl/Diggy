## Info
This is a fork of the Factorio scenraios created by RedMew (https://github.com/Refactorio/RedMew)

But it was stripped down to the Diggy scenario and include some modifications:

#### New preset: darkness (including torchlight feature)
There is no light in the cave. It is completely dark inside. Only the marketplace is lit up, and the players can use wooden torches to illuminate their surroundings. You can also build lamps in your base to combat the darkness.
